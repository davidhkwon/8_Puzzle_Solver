# 8_Puzzle_Solver
This project applies state-space search to the classic problem known as the 8-Puzzle. The 8-Puzzle is a 3x3 grid containing eight numbered tiles and one blank tile. The goal is to reach the configuration shown below:
 
     0 1 2
     3 4 5
     6 7 8

Most notably, this project utilizes four algorithms: BFS, DFS, Greedy Search, and A* with varying configurations in order to determine which algorithm is the most efficient. The criteria for efficiency were determined by the number of trials solved, the average amount of moves, and the average amount of states tested. In conclusion, A* (heuristic 2) was the most efficient algorithm when it comes to solving 8-Puzzle.
